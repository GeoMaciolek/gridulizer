This is a very simple 3D visualizer of Mutable Grids' pattern banks.

The X and Y axes are the equivalent X and Y coordinates in Grids.

The Z axis is the steps of the pattern

Object size represents the probability of the step being a trigger (with "density" affecting this threshold) and correspondingly, an accent.

Instruments are BD, SD, HH from top to bottom

Maybe at some point I'll turn this into a playable Web MIDI sequencer thing.
